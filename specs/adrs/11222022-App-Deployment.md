# App Deployment

## Context and Problem Statement

*What Platform do we use to host our application?*

## Considered Options

### Application Host

* Web Deployment using GitHub Pages
* Deployment on Electron JS
* Using a locally hosted server on Firebase

## Decision Outcome

### Application Host
**The application is to be deployed through Electron JS platform, as it is capable of hosting a desktop application that is rendered using the web platform, Chromium. This is able to extract the same development and technicalities as a web-hosted application. We can also use it to host on mobile platforms.**
