# Add Tasks and Paddings Modals

## Context and Problem Statement

Should both padding and task creation boxes be dispalyed?
Should they be buttons which open pop-up modals?

## Considered Options

### Original Add Task Display:
* Have to click button that swaps from add padding to add task
* Only one creation box dispalyed
* Not very clear which one is dispalyed or how to switch to other

### Pop up Add Task Display:
* Have two buttons 
* One for add tasks, one for add padding
* Either button opens pop-up for correct task or padding creation

## Decision Outcome

### Pop up Add Task Display:
* Have two buttons 
* One for add tasks, one for add padding
* Either button opens pop-up for correct task or padding creation
