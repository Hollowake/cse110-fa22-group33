# DevOp Tutorial

## Steps:
1. When you want to work on a new feature, create a new branch off of `main` with a descriptive title.

3. Work on this branch until you believe the feature is ready or you would like feedback from others.
   1. Please use descriptive commit messages and try your best to commit often.
4. Once your code is ready for review, create a pull request merging your branch with `main`.
5. To get your code merged, it should pass all the status checks, as well as get approved by two people outside of whoever is working on the branch
