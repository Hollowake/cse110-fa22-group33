# Phase 1 Notes

- linting and code style enforcement (may happen in pipeline and/or in editor)
- code quality via tool  (ex. Codeclimate, Codacy, etc.)
- code quality via human review (ex. Pull Requests)
- unit tests via automation (ex. Jest, Tape, Ava, Cypress, Mocha/Chai, etc.)*
- documentation generation via automation (ex. JSDocs)

## Pipeline so far:
1. Added super-linter which scans html, css and javascript files
