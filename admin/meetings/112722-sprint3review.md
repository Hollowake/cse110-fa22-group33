### Discussion

Padding:
- Two Types of padding:
  - Padding to be displayed
  - Padding to block out time and not displayed
- Should user be able to set both?
- Only use recurring padding once for sleep time

  - River hasn't been able to get it working
  - Would be a good way to implement setting padding
