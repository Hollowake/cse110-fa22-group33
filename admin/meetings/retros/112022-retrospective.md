### What Went Well
* Great communication
* Successfully implemented significant components of project (naive scheduling algorithm, creating task objects in storage)
* More collaboration found across subteams

### What Didn't Go Well
* Need more styling, better navigation
* Lack of meeting attendance -> had to bring people back up to speed
* Implementation of unit testing
* Improved daily standup quality
* Clean up repo

### How Can We Improve
* Implement more testing into code
* Set up better meeting system to make sure cross-collaboration stays consistent
* Improve our attendance for all meetings
* Help others on their sections if you finish your responsibilities first

### Immediate Discussion Decisions
* Ensure collaboration across teams
* Ensure availability for meeting
* Don't forget to send daily standups
