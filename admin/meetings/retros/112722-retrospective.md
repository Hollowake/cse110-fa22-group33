### What Went Well

-	Positive vibes all around on the overall progress for the project
-	Progress is being made, with debugging occurring often
-	Core functionality of application works (i.e. scheduling, cross-nav, initialization of tasks)
### What Didnâ€™t Go Well
-	UI is something that requires prioritized attention
-	Unit Testing is still missing, need to include them
-	Feels like we get stuck in the weeds too much which slows down progress
### What Needs to Improve
-	Better goal-setting and assignment of roles
-	Communication needs to continue being effective, since this helps team stay intact as a team
-	Everyone should work
### Immediate Discussion Decisions
-	Communication needs immediate improvement
-	We need to focus on UI and Testing
-	Assign roles and complete your delegated task
