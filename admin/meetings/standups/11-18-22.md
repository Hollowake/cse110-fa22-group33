### River
I discussed some implementation of the task.js and I will work on it more tomorrow, planning to meet tomorrow also.

Today meeting up with Sky and River to work on the scheduling algorithm. Need to complete the creation of task objects in local storage and run our "naive" scheduler to allocate tasks sequentially.
